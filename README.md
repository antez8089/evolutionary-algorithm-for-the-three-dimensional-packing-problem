# evolutionary-algorithm-for-the-three-dimensional-packing-problem
This repository focuses on the development and analysis of evolutionary algorithms applied to the three-dimensional packing problem, a complex optimization.he goal is to maximize spatial efficiency while respecting constraints such as item dimensions, orientations, and stacking rules.
